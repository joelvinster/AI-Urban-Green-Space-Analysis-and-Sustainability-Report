## Project Overview

Urban green spaces are critical for sustainable city living as they help combat pollution, regulate urban temperature, and maintain ecological balance.  
This project assesses urban green cover using satellite NDVI imagery classified with a Random Forest model, maps green spaces via OpenStreetMap data, analyzes climate conditions with NASA data, and performs sentiment analysis on urban green space discussions in research literature.
